# Dependent/Normal Page Converter

## Description

Isn't it a huge pain to create a page and then realize you actually meant to have it nested in a principal page? You can save it with XML surgery, but that's annoying and error-prone. And what if you have a page that no longer needs to be nested within a principal page? Easier XML surgery, but still XML surgery.

Fret no more!

This experiment aims to automate that hackery. It's a list of pages with two contextual row actions:

- Convert to normal page
- Convert to dependent page

The actions are pretty self explanatory. And I tried to uplevel most of the actions to action sequences with descriptions. The actual XML conversion is handled by two snippets. Those snippets are commented throughout to illustrate what they're doing. 

The Salesforce version of this page has a few additional scripts to handle the way we have to save pages on Salesforce due to field length limitations.

To install, either copy and paste the XML for your platform of choice into your Nintex Apps site, or use the XML + JSON file with the `skuid CLI`. 

## Caveats

- When converting from a _dependent page_ to a _normal page_, all components are placed into the page based on the order they appear. If you use page regions as grids, you'll need to recreate those.
- When converting from a  _normal page_ to a _dependent page_, all components are placed into the **the first page region available**.
- If you reference a principal page's resources in a dependent page and convert that dependent page to a normal page, it'll mess up.
- If you make edits to the Nintex Apps platform page, you will be prompted to enter sample metadata for the merge variables used in the model conditions. The following sample values will work:
    - apiVersion:v2
    - search: page
    - .: test
## Future improvement ideas

- Allow some form of import for reference principal pages
- _Dependent page_ to a _normal page_: Instead of dumping all components vertically into the XML, convert the each `pageregion` component into a Responsive Grid in order to maintain some visual similarity to the original page.
- _Normal page_ to a _dependent page_: Allow users to select which page region they would like to place their components in. 

## Sources and other notes

Here are some sources I used while drafting this:

- Based off some learnings from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14340894/create-xml-in-javascript/34047092#34047092
- HTMLcolleciton to array: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/222841/most-efficient-way-to-convert-an-htmlcollection-to-an-array
- Stringify the XML: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Parsing_and_serializing_XML

**Note**: Principal and dependent pages were previously known as master and child pages, respectively. You may still see references to this terminology in older materials or Nintex Apps metadata.
